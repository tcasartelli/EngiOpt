"""Least-Volume Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (LV-VQVAE).

Based on https://github.com/dome272/VQGAN-pytorch with an "Online Clustered Codebook" for better codebook usage from https://github.com/lyndonzheng/CVQ-VAE/blob/main/quantise.py

This implementation is composed of two primary Stages:
    - Stage 1 is a VQVAE: an autoencoder (AE) with a discrete latent space represented by a codebook.
      We additionally apply a least-volume (LV) objective with dynamic pruning to reduce the effective latent
      dimensionality n_z over the course of training.
    - Stage 2 is a generative model (a transformer in this case) trained on the discrete latent tokens from Stage 1.

The transformer uses nanoGPT (https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) instead of minGPT (https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) as in the original implementation.

For Stage 2, we take the indices of the codebook vectors and flatten them into a 1D sequence, treating them as training tokens.
The transformer is then trained to autoregressively predict each token in the sequence, after which it is reshaped back to the original 2D latent space and passed through the Stage 1 decoder to generate an image.
To make Stage 2 conditional, we train a separate VQVAE on the conditions only (CVQVAE) and replace the start-of-sequence tokens of the transformer with the CVQVAE latent tokens.

Notes for 20 January:
    - Check noqa's to remove later and implement the needed features
    - Need to reimplement features such as pruning and masking, including masking in the codebook and transformer stage, as well as extensive wandb metrics to validate
    - Implemented as of 20 January: spherical norm for codebook, commitment loss term beta 0.25 --> 0.01 for codebook, 1-Lipschitz decoder via new blocks and activation function (scaled tanh) + removal of non-Lipschitz blocks (i.e., self-attention)
    - Add back in ASAP: codebook perplexity, usage fraction/amount for codes and dims, number of active (non-pruned) codes and dims, etc.

Notes for 31 January:
    - Implemented actual LVAE version of dimension-wise pruning, added metrics back in, and tested. For plummet pruning the 0.02 threshold was far too low; setting to 0.25 worked better (256 --> 58 dims).
    - Need to test other pruning methods
    - Need to add back in code pruning and run ablation studies on order (before, after, at the same time as dim pruning) also with learning rate and other hyperparams

Notes for 5 February:
    - Tested other pruning methods: lognorm with threshold 0.1 is aggressive (alpha = 0.5) but generally works. Can be too aggressive for photonics so probably need to balance with recon. metric
    - pca_cdf uniformly cuts down to 1 dim if allowed so also would need a recon counter-force here
    - Models need a while to "warm up" before populating the codebook even before any LV applied, likely due to weakened 1-Lipschitz decoder.
        - TODO: explore how to mitigate this and encourage model to learn faster in the initial stages
        - TODO: find a better metric to represent loss of quality in reconstruction (current metrics seem not to capture it)

- TODO: create a custom json or similar file to hold the non-default args for each model tested (rather than hard-coding into submit_grid.sh)
